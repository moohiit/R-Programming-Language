# Module 3: Assignment 4 – Facet_grid() Attribute

# Problem Statement:
#   Now, Sam has to use facet_grid() function to make the plots more informative and
#   interactive for the customer churn and placement dataset. Now, Sam has to use
#   facet_grid() function to make the plots more informative and interactive for the customer
#   churn and placement dataset.

# Tasks to be performed:
# 1. Build a histogram for the ‘TotalCharges’ column. Map ‘gender’ onto fill aesthetic.
# a. Facet the plot w.r.t ‘gender’ column
     ggplot(data = customer_churn,aes(TotalCharges,fill=gender))+geom_histogram()+facet_grid(~gender)

# 2. Build a box-plot between ‘tenure’ & ‘InternetService’. Map ‘tenure’ on the y-axis &
#   ‘InternetService’ on the x-axis. Map ‘Contract’ to the fill aesthetic
# a. Facet the plot w.r.t ‘Contract’ column
     ggplot(data = customer_churn,aes(y=tenure,x=InternetService,fill=Contract))+geom_boxplot()+facet_grid(~Contract)
     
     
# 3. Build a scatter-plot between ‘etest_p’ & ‘mba_p’. Map ‘etest_p’ on the y-axis &
#   ‘mba_p’ on the x-axis. Map ‘degree_t’ onto col aesthetic
# a. Facet the plot w.r.t ‘degree_t’ column.
     ggplot(data = placement,aes(y=etest_p,x=mba_p,col=degree_t))+geom_point()+facet_grid(~degree_t)
